# Help

The code `pilot-study.py` must be inside the folder with the folders created in the `Dataset-setup` step.

The code `pilot-study.py` will produce a file `pilot.sh` that must run inside the folder where nerfstudio is installed and with conda environment activated by the command: `bash pilot.sh`.

The `requirements.txt` file should not be used to install dependecies, but only for knowledge. Installing the dependecies should be done by the user manually.
