## Steps
1. Put videos inside the same folder where the codes `create_folders.py` and `select_frames.py` are.
2. Run the code `create_folders.py` to create the folders of the videos projects.
3. Run the code `select_frames.py` to extract the right number of frames of each video.

The code `create_folders.py` currently works only for .MOV and .mp4 files. The codes currently only work when they are inside of the same folders of the videos.

The `requirements.txt` file should not be used to install dependecies, but only for knowledge. Installing the dependecies should be done by the user manually.
